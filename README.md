ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @walmirmarques

  I have a degree in computer science, I worked for a few years in the infrastructure area and I am returning to my studies to enter the world of programming.
  Currently I've been studying python because I've always been interested in the area of analysis and data science and I'm super excited to migrate my career.
  In June 2022 I am moving to Dublin, Ireland, seeking to improve my English and seek more knowledge in the programming area. I hope this trip opens many doors
for me and that I can achieve all my goals.

Below I'm leaving my profile on some social networks.
